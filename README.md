# Adaptive Exam Preparation AI

## 1️⃣ Overview

The goal of this system is to assist students in exam preparation by:

- Planning personalized study schedules  
- Generating quizzes based on knowledge gaps  
- Tracking performance and adapting difficulty  

The system is composed of three AI agents:

| Agent | Role | Core Functions |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Planner Agent** | Generates personalized study plans | Suggests topics, sets schedules, and adapts plans based on progress |
| **Quiz Generator Agent** | Creates quizzes based on topics & difficulty | Generates questions, answers, and explanations using NLP & LLM |
| **Performance Tracker Agent** | Tracks user performance and adapts difficulty | Monitors quiz results, recommends revisions, and provides insights |

## 2️⃣ System Architecture

High-Level Flow:

- Planner Agent → Quiz Generator: Decides what topics/questions to generate.

- Quiz Generator → Performance Tracker: Sends quiz results for evaluation.

- Performance Tracker → Planner Agent: Suggests updates to study plan based on performance.

## 3️⃣ Agent Details & Implementation

### 1. Planner Agent

**Functions:**
- Take user input: exam subject, topics, and available study time.
- Use an LLM to generate a structured study plan.
- Optionally summarize topic explanations for easier understanding.
- Output: Personalized study plan tailored to the user.

**Tools & Techniques:**
- Python
- Large Language Models (OpenAI API, HuggingFace LLaMA, etc.)
- NLP techniques (optional) for summarization and topic simplification

### 2. Quiz Generator Agent

**Functions:**
- Generate quizzes based on topics or the learner’s weak areas.
- Use NLP to extract key points and important concepts from topics.
- Leverage an LLM to generate multiple-choice or short-answer questions.
- Optionally adapt question difficulty based on user performance.

**Tools & Techniques:**
- Python
- NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) for key point extraction
- LLMs (OpenAI API, HuggingFace LLaMA) for question generation
- Adaptive logic to vary difficulty dynamically

### 3. Performance Tracker Agent

**Functions:**
- Track user answers and quiz scores.
- Analyze strengths and weaknesses across topics.
- Suggest topic revision or adjust quiz difficulty based on performance.
- Optionally provide detailed feedback explanations using embeddings + LLM.

**Tools & Techniques:**
- Python
- Simple scoring and analytics logic (Pandas/Numpy)
- Optional: embeddings + LLM for generating personalized feedback
- Streamlit for visualizing performance metrics and progress
